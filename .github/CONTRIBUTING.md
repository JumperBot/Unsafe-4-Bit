### How to start writing "the" code

The first and most important step is getting to know yourself and your setup:
  - Can you write code in `Java`?
    - Can you understand it's syntax ***properly***?
    - Can you solve common problems that occur when writing a program?
      - Have you experienced coding alone with no help?
      - Do you know when and how to ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)?
    - Do you have your `Java` environment setup ready?
      - Do you have a JDK that supports `Java-8` and above?
        - Check it with `java --version` on your terminal.
  - Do you know how to use `Git` or `GitHub` ***properly***?

Next step would be ***\*drum-roll\**** forking the repository!
  - You can now write the actual code.

### What to do when writing the code

  - Make the code **concise**.
  - Make the code **compact**.
  - Make the code **readable**.
    - Don't make it ***too readable*** or else we won't be accepting it!
    - Also, don't make the code ***too unreadable*** or else we won't be accepting it as well!
  - Take a look at some of the files to know what I meant by that.
  - Never forget to **test and compile** the code first on your machine before such reckless moves!

### What to do after writing the code

  - Check, test and compile your code into it's appropriate directory.
  - Commit your changes into your fork.
    - Use [Gitmojis](https://gitmoji.kaki87.net/) before your commit message to indicate what your commit is for.
  - Open up a [PR](https://github.com/JumperBot/Unsafe-4-Bit/compare).
    - Fill up the form!
  - Wait for me to accept your changes!

## Issues

### Create a new issue

If you spotted a problem or would like to create a new issue, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/JumperBot/Unsafe-4-Bit/issues/new/choose).
