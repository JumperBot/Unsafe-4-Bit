UFB reminds you of its ***lower-level counterparts*** as you manage your theoretical *256 bytes of memory*.

The [256 bytes of memory](./test/README.md#memory) includes two parts: ROM (38 bytes) and non-ROM (218 bytes).

The ***"freedom"*** of managing them yourself lets you ***"shoot yourself in the foot"***.

---

Write your first program full of [commands](./test/README.md#default-16), warnings and errors...

and [compile](./src/README.md#UFBC) and [run](./src/README.md#UFB) the program!
