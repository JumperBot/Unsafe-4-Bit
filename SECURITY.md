## Reporting a Vulnerability

After reading this, you should be all means go [**over here**](https://github.com/JumperBot/Unsafe-4-Bit/security/advisories/new).

A `security issue` can be something that strikes through someone's privacy or destroy the host machine by any manner.

## Submitting Troll Issues
`Trolls` or `Troll issues` will be `declined`, if ever you submit at least one troll issue:
- That issue will be `declined`.
- You are to never to be believed forever.
- Future issues from you, normal issues or security issues, will be labeled as `invalid` or `declined`.

Security is very seriouss, there is no valid reason to troll about it.

> Security issues might be fixed slower than expected or be fixed with a temporary solution.
